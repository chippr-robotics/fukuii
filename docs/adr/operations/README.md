# Operations ADRs

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records related to operational features, administration, monitoring, user interfaces, and deployment.

## Naming Convention

Operations ADRs use the format: `OPS-NNN-title.md` where NNN is a zero-padded sequential number.

Examples:
- `OPS-001-console-ui.md`
- `OPS-002-monitoring-strategy.md`

## Current ADRs

- [OPS-001: Enhanced Console User Interface](OPS-001-console-ui.md) - Accepted

## Creating a New Operations ADR

1. Use the next sequential number (e.g., `OPS-002-title.md`)
2. Follow the standard ADR template structure
3. Link it in the index above
4. Update the main ADR README
