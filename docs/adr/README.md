# Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the Fukuii Ethereum Classic client.

## What is an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences. ADRs help teams understand:

- What decisions were made
- Why those decisions were made
- What alternatives were considered
- What the expected outcomes and trade-offs are

## ADR Format

Each ADR follows this structure:

1. **Title**: Short descriptive title
2. **Status**: Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, or Superseded
3. **Context**: The issue or concern that prompted the decision
4. **Decision**: What was decided
5. **Consequences**: The results of the decision, both positive and negative
