# Gorgoroth Network - Validation Status

**Last Updated**: December 8, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ **CORE FUNCTIONALITY VALIDATED - TESTING INFRASTRUCTURE COMPLETE**

## Executive Summary

The Gorgoroth test network has been successfully established and core functionality has been validated. This document tracks the validation status for all compatibility areas requested in the original issue.

**Bonus**: For advanced real-world sync testing, see [Cirith Ungol Testing Guide](../cirith-ungol/TESTING_GUIDE.md).

## Validation Requirements

The following areas need to be validated for Fukuii compatibility with core-geth and besu:

1. ✅ Network Communication
2. ✅ Mining
3. ⚠️ Fast Sync (infrastructure ready, needs extended testing)
4. ⚠️ Snap Sync (infrastructure ready, needs extended testing)
5. ⚠️ Faucet Service (infrastructure ready, needs validation)

## Current Status

### 1. Network Communication - ✅ VALIDATED

**Status**: Fully validated and documented

**Evidence**: See [VERIFICATION_COMPLETE.md](VERIFICATION_COMPLETE.md)

**What was tested**:
- ✅ Peer discovery and handshakes
- ✅ Protocol compatibility (ETC64, SNAP1)
- ✅ Block propagation across Fukuii nodes
- ✅ Network connectivity in Docker environment
- ✅ Static node configuration

**Results**:
- All nodes successfully connect to peers
- Protocol versions compatible
- Block propagation works correctly
- No handshake failures

**Multi-client status**:
- ✅ Fukuii ↔ Fukuii: Validated (3-node and 6-node configs)
- ⚠️ Fukuii ↔ Core-Geth: Infrastructure ready (docker-compose-fukuii-geth.yml)
- ⚠️ Fukuii ↔ Besu: Infrastructure ready (docker-compose-fukuii-besu.yml)

**Next steps for complete validation**:
1. Run `fukuii-geth` configuration
2. Run `fukuii-besu` configuration
3. Execute automated test suite
4. Document results

### 2. Mining - ✅ VALIDATED

**Status**: Validated on Fukuii-only network

**Evidence**: See [VERIFICATION_COMPLETE.md](VERIFICATION_COMPLETE.md)

**What was tested**:
- ✅ Mining enabled on all nodes
- ✅ PoW consensus mechanism
- ✅ Block production
- ✅ Difficulty adjustment
- ✅ Mining coordinator instantiation

**Results**:
- Mining works correctly on Fukuii nodes
- Blocks are produced consistently
- PoW consensus maintained

**Multi-client status**:
- ✅ Fukuii mining: Validated
- ⚠️ Mixed client mining: Infrastructure ready
- ⚠️ Cross-client block acceptance: Infrastructure ready

**Next steps for complete validation**:
1. Start mixed client network (fukuii-geth or fukuii-besu)
2. Verify blocks mined by Core-Geth are accepted by Fukuii
3. Verify blocks mined by Fukuii are accepted by Core-Geth/Besu
4. Run mining compatibility tests
5. Document block distribution and consensus

### 3. Fast Sync - ⚠️ INFRASTRUCTURE READY

**Status**: Testing infrastructure created, extended validation needed

**Current configuration**:
- Fast sync is **disabled** in base configuration (`do-fast-sync = false`)
- This is intentional for the test network
- Infrastructure exists to enable and test fast sync

**Testing infrastructure**:
- ✅ Test procedures documented in [GORGOROTH_COMPATIBILITY_TESTING.md](../testing/GORGOROTH_COMPATIBILITY_TESTING.md)
- ✅ Configuration examples provided
- ✅ Test scenarios defined

**What needs to be tested**:
1. Fast sync from Fukuii node to new Fukuii node
2. Fast sync from Core-Geth to Fukuii
3. Fast sync from Besu to Fukuii
4. Fast sync from Fukuii to Core-Geth (if supported)
5. Fast sync from Fukuii to Besu (if supported)
6. State verification after sync
7. Performance metrics

**Blocking factors**:
- Requires network with sufficient block history (500+ blocks recommended)
- Requires time to generate blocks
- May require separate test configuration with fast sync enabled

**Recommended test procedure**:
1. Start network and let it mine 1000+ blocks
2. Add new node with fast sync enabled
3. Monitor sync progress
4. Verify final state matches
5. Repeat for different client combinations

### 4. Snap Sync - ⚠️ INFRASTRUCTURE READY

**Status**: Testing infrastructure created, needs capability verification and testing

**Current configuration**:
- Snap sync is **disabled** in base configuration (`do-snap-sync = false`)
- This is intentional for the test network
- Protocol support confirmed (SNAP1)

**Testing infrastructure**:
- ✅ Test procedures documented in [GORGOROTH_COMPATIBILITY_TESTING.md](../testing/GORGOROTH_COMPATIBILITY_TESTING.md)
- ✅ Configuration examples provided
- ✅ Capability check tests defined

**What needs to be tested**:
1. Verify which clients support snap sync (capability check)
2. Snap sync from Fukuii node to new Fukuii node
3. Snap sync from Core-Geth to Fukuii (if supported)
4. Snap sync from Besu to Fukuii (if supported)
5. State reconstruction verification
6. Performance comparison with fast sync

**Blocking factors**:
- Requires network with significant state (1000+ blocks recommended)
- Not all clients may support snap sync on ETC
- May require specific protocol negotiation

**Recommended test procedure**:
1. Check snap sync capability on all clients
2. If supported, start network and generate substantial state
3. Add new node with snap sync enabled
4. Monitor snap sync progress
5. Verify state is complete and queryable
6. Repeat for different client combinations

### 5. Faucet Service - ⚠️ INFRASTRUCTURE READY

**Status**: Testing infrastructure created, needs validation

**Current configuration**:
- Faucet service implementation exists in `src/main/scala/com/chipprbots/ethereum/faucet/`
- Configuration file: `src/main/resources/conf/faucet.conf`
- JSON-RPC API for fund distribution
- Testnet token distribution service

**Testing infrastructure**:
- ✅ Test script created: `test-scripts/test-faucet.sh`
- ✅ Documentation created: `FAUCET_TESTING.md`
- ✅ Configuration guide provided
- ✅ API reference documented

**What needs to be tested**:
1. Faucet service startup and initialization
2. Wallet configuration and fund availability
3. Fund distribution via JSON-RPC API
4. Transaction submission and confirmation
5. Balance verification after distribution
6. Rate limiting functionality
7. Error handling and edge cases

**Blocking factors**:
- Requires configured wallet with funds
- Requires running Fukuii node for transaction submission
- Requires mining enabled to confirm transactions

**Recommended test procedure**:
1. Configure faucet with genesis account from Gorgoroth
2. Start Gorgoroth network with mining enabled
3. Start faucet service pointing to network node
4. Verify faucet status endpoint
5. Request funds for test address
6. Verify transaction is submitted and mined
7. Confirm recipient balance increased
8. Test rate limiting and error conditions

### Phase 2: Cirith Ungol Real-World Testing (Bonus Trial)

For advanced testers ready for real-world validation:

**What is Cirith Ungol?**
- Single-node testing environment
- Syncs with **ETC mainnet** (20M+ blocks) or **Mordor testnet**
- Tests SNAP/Fast sync with real networks
- Validates long-term stability and production performance

**Why test with Cirith Ungol?**
- Validates sync capabilities with real network history
- Tests peer diversity (public network peers)
- Measures production performance
- Required before mainnet deployment

**Quick Start:**
```bash
cd ops/cirith-ungol

# Start sync with ETC mainnet
./start.sh start

# Monitor progress (SNAP sync: 2-6 hours)
./start.sh logs

# Collect results
./start.sh collect-logs
```

**What to validate:**
- [ ] SNAP sync completes with mainnet (2-6 hours)
- [ ] Connects to 10+ public peers
- [ ] Account/storage ranges download successfully
- [ ] Transitions to full sync automatically
- [ ] State is queryable after sync
- [ ] Node remains stable for 24+ hours
