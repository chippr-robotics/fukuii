# SNAP Sync Protocol Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the initial implementation of SNAP/1 protocol support in Fukuii. The SNAP protocol is a dependent satellite protocol of ETH that enables efficient state synchronization by downloading account and storage ranges without intermediate Merkle trie nodes.

## Current Implementation Status

### ✅ Completed

1. **Protocol Infrastructure** (Phase 1)
   - Added `SNAP` protocol family to `ProtocolFamily` enum
   - Added `SNAP1` capability definition (snap/1)
   - Updated capability parsing to recognize "snap/1"
   - Updated `usesRequestId` to include SNAP1 (uses request IDs like ETH66+)

2. **Message Definitions** (Phase 1)
   - Created `SNAP.scala` with all 8 SNAP/1 protocol messages:
     - `GetAccountRange` (0x00) - Request account ranges
     - `AccountRange` (0x01) - Response with accounts and proofs
     - `GetStorageRanges` (0x02) - Request storage slots
     - `StorageRanges` (0x03) - Response with storage and proofs
     - `GetByteCodes` (0x04) - Request contract bytecodes
     - `ByteCodes` (0x05) - Response with bytecodes
     - `GetTrieNodes` (0x06) - Request trie nodes for healing
     - `TrieNodes` (0x07) - Response with trie nodes

3. **Message Encoding/Decoding** (Phase 2 - COMPLETED)
   - Implemented complete RLP encoding for all 8 SNAP messages
   - Implemented complete RLP decoding for all 8 SNAP messages
   - Added comprehensive error handling with descriptive messages

   - ✅ Implemented timeout handling for pending requests
   - ✅ Added response validation for all SNAP message types
   - ✅ Request ID generation and tracking
   - ✅ Monotonic ordering validation for account and storage ranges

5. **Account Range Sync** (Phase 4 - MOSTLY COMPLETE ⚠️)
   - ✅ Created AccountTask for managing account range state
   - ✅ Implemented task creation and division for parallel downloads
   - ✅ Created AccountRangeDownloader for coordinating downloads
   - ✅ Request/response lifecycle management
   - ✅ Progress tracking and statistics reporting
   - ✅ Task continuation handling for partial responses
   - ✅ Timeout handling and task retry
   - ✅ Merkle proof verification (MerkleProofVerifier)
   - ✅ Account data validation (nonce, balance, storageRoot, codeHash)

   - ✅ Integration with EtcPeerManager for sending requests

6. **Configuration** (Phase 1)
   - Added "snap/1" to capabilities list in all chain configurations:
     - `etc-chain.conf` (Ethereum Classic mainnet)
     - `mordor-chain.conf` (Ethereum Classic testnet)
     - `eth-chain.conf` (Ethereum mainnet)
     - `test-chain.conf` (test network)
     - `ropsten-chain.conf` (Ropsten testnet)

7. **Documentation** (Phase 1)
   - Updated ETH68.scala documentation to reference SNAP/1 for state sync
   - Created comprehensive message documentation with protocol references
   - Created ADR documenting architecture decisions

   - ✅ Integration with EtcPeerManager for sending storage requests
   - ✅ Batched storage requests (multiple accounts per request)

### ⏳ Not Yet Implemented

The following components are required for a complete SNAP sync implementation but are NOT yet included:

1. **State Healing** (Phase 6)
   - Detect missing trie nodes
   - Request missing nodes via GetTrieNodes
   - Reassemble complete state trie

2. **Integration** (Phase 7)
   - Integration with existing FastSync
   - Pivot block selection for snap sync
   - State validation and healing
   - Transition from snap sync to regular sync

## Why This Approach?

The issue reports that Fukuii sends `bestBlock=0` (genesis) during status exchange, causing peers to disconnect. While implementing full SNAP sync would eventually solve this, it's a massive undertaking (months of work).

This initial implementation provides:

1. **Protocol Awareness**: Fukuii can now advertise SNAP/1 capability during handshake
2. **Foundation**: Message structures are defined and ready for future implementation
3. **Compatibility**: Better compatibility with modern Ethereum clients that expect SNAP support
4. **Incremental Development**: Allows gradual implementation of SNAP sync features

## Relationship to Existing Fast Sync

Fukuii already has a "fast sync" implementation that:
- Selects a pivot block
- Downloads state at that pivot block
- Then continues with regular block-by-block sync

The SNAP protocol would enhance this by:
- Reducing bandwidth by 99.26% (downloading state without intermediate trie nodes)
- Reducing sync time by 80.6%
- Allowing parallel downloads of account and storage ranges
- Supporting "self-healing" when state moves due to new blocks

## Next Steps

To complete SNAP sync implementation, the following work is needed (in priority order):

1. **~~Complete Message Encoding/Decoding~~ ✅ COMPLETED (Phase 2)**

## Performance Benefits (from SNAP spec)

Based on Ethereum mainnet block ~#11,177,000:

| Metric | ETH (old) | SNAP (new) | Improvement |
|--------|-----------|------------|-------------|
| Time | 10h 50m | 2h 6m | -80.6% |
| Upload | 20.38 GB | 0.15 GB | -99.26% |
| Download | 43.8 GB | 20.44 GB | -53.33% |
| Packets | 1607M | 0.099M | -99.993% |
| Disk Reads | 15.68 TB | 0.096 TB | -99.39% |

## Note on Current Block Sync Issue

The immediate issue (peers disconnecting due to `bestBlock=0`) is partially addressed by existing bootstrap checkpoint logic in the status exchange handlers. However, full SNAP sync implementation would:

1. Allow faster initial sync from a recent snapshot
2. Reduce the "stuck at genesis" period from hours to minutes
3. Improve peer compatibility with modern clients
4. Enable better sync performance overall

## Implementation Timeline Estimate
