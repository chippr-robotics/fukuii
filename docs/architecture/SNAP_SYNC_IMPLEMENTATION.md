# SNAP Sync Protocol Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the initial implementation of SNAP/1 protocol support in Fukuii. The SNAP protocol is a dependent satellite protocol of ETH that enables efficient state synchronization by downloading account and storage ranges without intermediate Merkle trie nodes.

## Current Implementation Status

### ✅ Completed

   - Added `SNAP` protocol family to `ProtocolFamily` enum
   - Added `SNAP1` capability definition (snap/1)
   - Updated capability parsing to recognize "snap/1"
   - Updated `usesRequestId` to include SNAP1 (uses request IDs like ETH66+)

2. **Message Definitions** (Phase 1)
   - Created `SNAP.scala` with all 8 SNAP/1 protocol messages:
     - `GetAccountRange` (0x00) - Request account ranges
     - `AccountRange` (0x01) - Response with accounts and proofs
     - `GetStorageRanges` (0x02) - Request storage slots

     - `mordor-chain.conf` (Ethereum Classic testnet)
     - `eth-chain.conf` (Ethereum mainnet)
     - `test-chain.conf` (test network)

### ⏳ Not Yet Implemented

The following components are required for a complete SNAP sync implementation but are NOT yet included:

1. **Integration and Testing** (Phase 7)
   - Integration with existing FastSync
   - Pivot block selection for snap sync
   - Automatic sync mode selection
   - State validation and completeness checking
   - Transition from snap sync to regular sync
   - End-to-end testing with geth/erigon peers
   - Performance benchmarking and optimization

## Why This Approach?

The issue reports that Fukuii sends `bestBlock=0` (genesis) during status exchange, causing peers to disconnect. While implementing full SNAP sync would eventually solve this, it's a massive undertaking (months of work).

This initial implementation provides:

1. **Protocol Awareness**: Fukuii can now advertise SNAP/1 capability during handshake
2. **Foundation**: Message structures are defined and ready for future implementation
3. **Compatibility**: Better compatibility with modern Ethereum clients that expect SNAP support
4. **Incremental Development**: Allows gradual implementation of SNAP sync features

## Relationship to Existing Fast Sync

Fukuii already has a "fast sync" implementation that:
- Selects a pivot block
- Downloads state at that pivot block
- Then continues with regular block-by-block sync

The SNAP protocol would enhance this by:
- Reducing bandwidth by 99.26% (downloading state without intermediate trie nodes)
- Reducing sync time by 80.6%
- Allowing parallel downloads of account and storage ranges
- Supporting "self-healing" when state moves due to new blocks

## Performance Benefits (from SNAP spec)

Based on Ethereum mainnet block ~#11,177,000:

| Metric | ETH (old) | SNAP (new) | Improvement |
|--------|-----------|------------|-------------|
| Time | 10h 50m | 2h 6m | -80.6% |
| Upload | 20.38 GB | 0.15 GB | -99.26% |
| Download | 43.8 GB | 20.44 GB | -53.33% |
| Packets | 1607M | 0.099M | -99.993% |
| Disk Reads | 15.68 TB | 0.096 TB | -99.39% |

## Note on Current Block Sync Issue

The immediate issue (peers disconnecting due to `bestBlock=0`) is partially addressed by existing bootstrap checkpoint logic in the status exchange handlers. However, full SNAP sync implementation would:

1. Allow faster initial sync from a recent snapshot
2. Reduce the "stuck at genesis" period from hours to minutes
3. Improve peer compatibility with modern clients
4. Enable better sync performance overall
