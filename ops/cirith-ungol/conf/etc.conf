# Testbed Configuration - ETC Mainnet Fast Sync Testing
# This configuration re-enables the legacy fast sync pipeline to validate
# catch-up performance on the ETC public network and capture fast-sync logs.
# Focus is on verifying peer capability exchange, fast-sync progress, and timeouts.

# This is the base configuration file for the Fukuii ETC client.
include "conf/base/fukuii.conf"

# This where all the default settings are defined.
# It should always go at the top.
