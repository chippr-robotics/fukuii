## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Production release checklist in ETC-HANDOFF.md
- Shared test helper library for Gorgoroth test scripts (`ops/gorgoroth/test-scripts/lib/test-helpers.sh`)
- Static nodes configuration support via `static-nodes.json` file in datadir
  - Nodes can now load peer configuration from `<datadir>/static-nodes.json`
  - **Public mode**: Static nodes are merged with bootstrap nodes from chain config for better sync experience
  - **Enterprise mode**: Uses ONLY static nodes, ignores bootstrap nodes to prevent unintentional public network connections
  - Enables dynamic peer management for private/test networks without config file changes
  - Fully integrated with existing peer discovery system
  - Controlled via `public` and `enterprise` command-line modifiers
- Release automation with one-click releases
- Automated CHANGELOG generation from commit history
- SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) generation in CycloneDX format
- Assembly JAR attachment to GitHub releases
- Release Drafter for auto-generated release notes
- EIP-3651 implementation: Warm COINBASE address at transaction start (see VM-003)
  - Added `eip3651Enabled` configuration flag to `EvmConfig`
  - Added helper method to check EIP-3651 activation status
  - COINBASE address is now marked as warm when EIP-3651 is enabled, reducing gas costs by 2500 for first access
  - Comprehensive test suite with 11 tests covering gas cost changes and edge cases

### Changed
- Renamed GHCR image path from `chordodes_fukuii` to `fukuii` across all CI/CD, docs, and scripts
- Modernized CI apt-key pattern to use `signed-by` keyring (replaces deprecated `apt-key add`)
- Renamed `logback-node2-sync-trace.xml` → `logback-sync-trace.xml` (not node-specific)
- Deduplicated `CONTRIBUTING.md` — root and `docs/` copies now redirect to canonical `docs/development/contributing.md`
- Fixed confused rebrand text in contributing docs (was "Fukuii to Fukuii", now "Mantis to Fukuii")
- Enhanced release workflow to include all artifacts
- Updated documentation for release process
- Modified `ProgramState` initialization to conditionally include COINBASE in warm addresses set

### Fixed
- **Critical**: Fixed ETH68 peer connection failures due to incorrect message decoder order
  - Network protocol messages (Hello, Disconnect, Ping, Pong) are now decoded before capability-specific messages
  - Resolves issue where peers would disconnect immediately after handshake with "Cannot decode Disconnect" error
  - Fixes "Unknown eth/68 message type: 1" debug messages
  - Node can now maintain stable peer connections and sync properly with ETH68-capable peers

## [0.1.0] - Initial Version

### Added
- Initial Fukuii Ethereum Client codebase (forked from Mantis)
- Rebranded from Fukuii to Fukuii throughout codebase
- Updated package names from io.iohk to com.chipprbots
- GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
- Docker container support with signed images
- Comprehensive documentation
