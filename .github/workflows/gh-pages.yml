# GitHub Pages Deployment Workflow
#
# This workflow deploys documentation from the docs/ folder to GitHub Pages
# using MkDocs Material for enhanced features including:
# - Mermaid diagram rendering
# - Full-text search
# - Audience-focused navigation tabs
# - Dark/light mode toggle
#
# URL: https://chippr-robotics.github.io/fukuii/
#
# Triggers:
# - Push to main/master/develop branches (docs changes)
# - Manual dispatch for ad-hoc deployments
# - Pull requests (build only, no deploy - for validation)
