# GitHub Pages Deployment Workflow
#
# This workflow deploys documentation from the docs/ folder to GitHub Pages.
# Documentation is kept in the same branch as code for AI agents to consume,
# while still being accessible via GitHub Pages at:
# https://chippr-robotics.github.io/fukuii/
#
# Triggers:
# - Push to main/master/develop branches (docs changes)
# - Manual dispatch for ad-hoc deployments
# - Pull requests (build only, no deploy - for validation)
